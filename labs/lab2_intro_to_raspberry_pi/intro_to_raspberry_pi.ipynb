The following page at that link has directions for testing to make sure it's working. Once the firmware is installed, you may need to press the `STOP/RESTART` button multiple times until the Micropython shell appears on the bottom tab of Thonny. Once you see the Micropython shell, the Pico is connected to Thonny."

    "The Raspberry Pi Pico has its own internal temperature sensor that returns an integer between 0 and 65535. In this example, our experiment involves measuring the internal temperature of the Pico, and the sample space is represented by the set $\\{0,1,2,\\dots, 65535\\}$. We can easily calculate the temperature in Celsius from the sensor reading $r$ using the formula: \n",

The purpose of this script is to capture a total of 12 temperature readings, with measurements taken at intervals of 0.25 seconds, and save them to a file named `temp.txt` on the Pico.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the firmware installation, open Thonny and go to the top bar. Under *\"View\"*, select \"*Files\"* to bring up a side bar that allows you to transfer files onto your Pico. In the side bar, navigate to your *\"Downloads\"* folder. If you're unsure, you can find it at `/home/shay/a/\"your username\"/Downloads`. Right-click the `pico_temperature.py` file and choose *\"Upload to /\"* to copy the file onto your Pico.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Thonny, execute the `pico_temperature.py` script on the Pico by pressing the `RUN` button, it should look like a green play button. Once the script finishes running, transfer the `temp.txt` file stored on the Pico to the folder you are currently working in, and then delete `temp.txt` from the Pico's storage. Feel free to modify the `pico_temperature.py` script as necessary to adjust the number of measurements or the measurement interval."
